          Hi! I'm Bryce üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

          I am a Junior studying computer science at NCSU (<strong>GO PACK</strong> <span role='img'>üê∫</span>).
          For <strong>7 months</strong> of 2019 I was lucky enough to intern at <strong>Nokia</strong> in the Bay Area,
          where I collaborated with QA professionals to maintain their test infrastructure. Exposure to a QA system
          at the size and complexity Nokia's gave me an appreciation for thorough and scalable testing that
          I didn't have before my internship. 
        </p>

          Being surrounded by the passionate people and high-energy culture leading software innovation was one
          of the coolest experiences of my life and definitely had a last impact on my perspective of the industry. 
          I am super excited to be a part of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This summer I will be interning at <strong>Cisco</strong> in RTP as a software engineer, where I hope to make tangible contributions
          to my team as well as get my hands dirty with some new technology and tools I've never used before.
        </p>

          When I'm not coding I love hiking and discovering new music, so the Bay was a perfect fit for me.
          Almost every weekend I was exploring the countless natural landmarks or seeing my favorite
          artists live in San Francisco. 
        </p>
        <p>

          The Upper Yosemite Falls was easily one of my favorite hiking experiences, despite
          almost not making it back due to a lack of preparation (long story). This trail is 
          one-upped only by the Pikchu trail I climbed in Peru a year ago, which winds up the
          mountain Pikchu for a cinematic view of the city Cusco.

          At the start of this summer I'm doing a tour of 11 European contries, hopefully my hiking
          portfolio will be a little longer by the end!
