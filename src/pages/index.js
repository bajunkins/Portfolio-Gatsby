          Hi! I'm Bryce üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

            I am a Junior studying computer science at NCSU (<strong>GO PACK</strong> <span role='img'>üê∫</span>).
            Computer Science to me is the most exciting thing in the <strong>world</strong>, because it is the
            front line of technological innovation at this point in history. The insanely low barrier to entry and abundance of
            resources online means <strong>anyone</strong> with an internet connection and a computer can contribute.
            
        </p>

        <p>When I'm not coding, I love discovering new music, hiking, and exploring 
            obscure internet communities.

          For <strong>7 months</strong> of 2019 I was lucky enough to intern at Nokia in the Bay Area, where I had the time of my life going to 
          concerts in SF and exploring the never-ending supply of jaw-dropping landmarks. At the same time,
          I was gaining invaluable industry experience and learning from the innovative and fast-paced Silicon Valley
          culture.

          This summer I will be interning at Cisco as a software engineer, where I hope to make tangible contributions
          to my team as well as get my hands dirty with some new technology and tools I've never used before.
