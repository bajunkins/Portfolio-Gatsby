      WolfSnax is being built by the club <a href="https://techatncsu.github.io/">Tech At NCSU</a> which I am the Vice President of! Our
      mission is to build quality software for nonprofits, and right now we are making a volunteer management tool
      for a local food pantry called Feed The Pack.
